1. Is the lack of consent (except for TOS) good?
No, it is not ideal that the system does not use consent beyond accepting the Terms of Service. Consent is essential to ensure transparency and compliance with data protection laws like GDPR and CCPA. Without explicit consent mechanisms, users may not be aware of how their data is collected, used, or shared. This can lead to a lack of trust and potential legal issues. Implementing consent for specific actions, such as data collection or cookies, ensures users have control over their information and builds trust while protecting their privacy.

2. Example page requiring consent and why itâ€™s needed?

Why Consent is Required: Cookies that track user behavior for analytics, advertising, or personalization purposes require explicit consent under privacy laws like GDPR. Such data is considered personal information, and users must have the ability to opt-in or opt-out of its collection. By providing consent, users are informed about the tracking mechanisms in place and can control how their data is used, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and fostering user trust.
