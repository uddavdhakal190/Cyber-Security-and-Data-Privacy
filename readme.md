1. Access Control Issues
   
Findings:
The system does not clearly distinguish access control mechanisms between administrators and reservers.
Potential risk: Unauthorized users might access or modify data they shouldn't.

Fix:
Implement role-based access control (RBAC):
Restrict resource management (add/edit/delete resources) to administrators only.
Restrict reservation creation to registered users over 15 years old.
Validate the user’s role on every request to protected resources.

2. Age Validation for Reservers
   
Findings:
The system should ensure users under 15 cannot book resources, but there’s no indication of age verification in the code.
Without this check, users might bypass the restriction and book resources.

Fix:
Enforce age validation during reservation creation.
Store the user's date of birth during registration and calculate their age dynamically.

3. Session and Authentication Security
   
Findings:
Session handling in the login system may use insecure practices (e.g., in-memory session storage, lack of secure cookies).
Potential risks:
Session hijacking if cookies are not marked as HttpOnly or Secure.
No token expiration increases attack surfaces.

Fix:
Improve session and authentication security:
Use JWTs with a short expiration time for session tokens.
Ensure cookies are HttpOnly, Secure, and have the SameSite attribute.
Use a secure session store (e.g., Redis) instead of in-memory storage.

4. Exposure of Reserver’s Identity
   
Findings:
The system specifications state that reservation details can be viewed without logging in, but the reserver's identity should not be shown.
Currently, there’s no verification that the identity is hidden when displaying reservations.

Fix:
Ensure that public views of reservations redact personal information:
Replace the reserver's name or ID with generic placeholders, e.g., Reserved.

5. Security Header and Input Validation Gaps
   
Findings:
Missing Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, and input validation, making the system vulnerable to:
XSS attacks if user inputs are displayed without proper escaping.
Clickjacking attacks due to missing X-Frame-Options.

Fix:
Add robust security headers to prevent common attacks:
Set Content-Security-Policy to allow only trusted sources:
Add X-Frame-Options: DENY to avoid clickjacking.
Validate all user inputs using libraries like Zod (in Deno) for javascript or pydantic (in Python).
